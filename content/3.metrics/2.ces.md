# Customer Effort Score (CES)

The **Customer Effort Score (CES)** is a metric that evaluates how much effort a customer needs to make to solve a problem or complete a task with a company.

## How it works

CES is measured by asking the question:

> "How much effort did you have to put forth to resolve your issue?"

The answer is given on a scale from 1 to 7 (or 1 to 5), where lower values indicate greater effort.

## Calculation

\[
CES = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} r_i}{n}
\]

Where \( r_i \) is the response of the \( i \)-th respondent and \( n \) is the total number of responses.
