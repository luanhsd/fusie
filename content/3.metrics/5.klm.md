# Keystroke-Level Model (KLM)

The **Keystroke-Level Model (KLM)** is a human-computer interaction modeling technique that estimates the time required to perform a detailed task in a system.

## How it works

KLM breaks down a task into basic actions (keystrokes, clicks, pointing, etc.) and assigns an average time to each action. The sum of these times provides an estimate of the total time to complete the task.

## Application

- Useful for predicting and analyzing user performance in specific tasks.
- Helps identify usability bottlenecks.
