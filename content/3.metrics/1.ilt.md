# Interactive Load Time (iLT)

**Interactive Load Time (iLT)** measures the wait time associated with continuous user interactions in interactive web applications, going beyond the initial page load.

## How it works

\[
iLT = Ene - Ens
\]

- \( Ens \): moment when the user interaction starts.
- \( Ene \): moment when the perceptible feedback related to the interaction is completed.

Reference values:
- Good: less than 2-3 seconds
- Poor: above 5-10 seconds
