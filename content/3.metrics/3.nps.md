# Net Promoter Score (NPS)

**Net Promoter Score (NPS)** is a metric created by Fred Reichheld in 2003 to measure customer loyalty to a company. It is widely used to assess customer satisfaction and the likelihood of recommending a product or service.

## How it works

NPS is calculated based on users' responses to the question:

> "On a scale from 0 to 10, how likely are you to recommend our company to a friend or colleague?"

Respondents are classified into three groups:
- **Promoters (9-10):** Loyal customers who recommend the company.
- **Passives (7-8):** Satisfied but unenthusiastic customers.
- **Detractors (0-6):** Unsatisfied customers.

## Calculation

\[
NPS = \% \text{Promoters} - \% \text{Detractors}
\]

The result ranges from -100 to 100.
