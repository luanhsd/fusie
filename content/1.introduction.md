# ðŸ“– Official Fusie Documentation

Have you ever wondered how to truly ensure an excellent experience for your application's users? Or felt the lack of a clear, well-founded, and reusable process to measure and improve user experience quality in your projects?

FUSIE was born from this very concern. As a developer, the author realized that there is often a lack of guidance and documentation on how to effectively measure user experience. There are no well-defined, evidence-based processes to help measure and improve user experience in a consistent and centralized way.

To fill these gaps, FUSIE proposes a catalog of user experience metrics, bringing together processes, metrics, and artifacts in one place. The goal is to make it easier to analyze the evolution of systems and products, ensure the quality of user experience, and reduce negative impacts directly related to usage.

To achieve this, this research investigated recognized standards, essential characteristics of user experience, widely used market metrics, and, most importantly, the gaps that exist both in the literature and in practice.

Explore FUSIE and discover how to turn user experience into a competitive advantage for your product!
